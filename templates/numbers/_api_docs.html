  <p><b>Bitcoin Numbers</b></p>
  <h5 class="text-subtitle1 q-my-none">
    A provably fair "numbers" game, powered by Bitcoin block data.
  </h5>
  <p>
    Set a date/time, odds, and at that time the latest bitcoin block hash will
    be fetched and a winning number calculated.
    <br /><br />How it works: <br />On the closing date, the game takes the last
    block hash and converts it to a number between 0 and (whatever you set the
    odds to). <br />The higher the Odds, the more difficult it is to win/the
    more users win (-haircut). <br />Max Odds is 10,000,000-1 <br /><br />Risks:
    <br />This game relies on block data from mempool.space, which means you're
    trusting them not to manipulate it. <br />In theory, this game could skewer
    mining incentives, if the prize were so big its within miners interest to
    mine a block with certain hash ending.
